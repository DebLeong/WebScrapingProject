“Polka dots can’t stay alone, like the communicative life of people,” she has stated. “Two and three and more polka dots become movement. Our earth is only one polka dot among the million stars in the cosmos. Polka dots are a way to infinity.”
Yayoi Kusama, Manhattan Suicide Addict, Tokyo 1978.

Executed in the unmistakable pattern of dots and expansive nets that permeates the life and work of Yayoi Kusama, Star from 1993 is a scintillating example of the Japanese artist’s iconic pictorial syntax. In vivid hues of indigo, violet and luminescent yellow against deep black brushtrokes, the composition seems to pulsate with a psychedelic and electric vibrancy. Its mesmeric pattern of biomorphic shapes and clustered polka-dots fills the canvas, forming a visually arresting image that exemplifies the decades-long career of an artist who has redefined the parameters of contemporary art. Composed in the same year that Kusama was invited to be the first solo artist and the first women ever to grace the Japanese Pavilion at the 45th Venice Biennale, the present work is testament to one of the most pivotal moments of the artist’s career. This exhibition marked Kusama’s return to the global stage and the beginning of an illustrious new chapter, which would earn her position as one of the most important living artists today.

Born in 1929, Kusama has produced a prolific and diverse oeuvre – spanning painting, sculpture and performance art – which has continued to evolve and expand with astonishing originality for more than half a century. Kusama first emerged as an artworld sensation in New York the early 1960s, alongside artists such as Andy Warhol and Donald Judd. Deeply concerned with the world around her, she has developed a practice that contemplates the interconnectivity between the universe and the lives of the people who inhabit it. This is articulated through the artist’s hallmark aesthetic of repeated dots, which seep across her canvases, sculptures and infinity rooms in a process she has termed ‘self-obliteration’.

Kusama’s renowned Infinity Nets offer a compelling manifestation of this entwining correlation between the elements of the world: “The sun, the moon, the earth and stars are also polka dots,” she explicates. “They cannot exist alone. Each and every one of us are polka dots. We gather and weave a beautiful pattern of polka dots” (Yayoi Kusama cited in: ‘Yayoi Kusama Answers the Proust Questionnaire’, Vanity Fair, 8 March 2019, online). In Star, the intricate nets and webs of her earlier paintings, composed of painstakingly rendered polka-dots, have metamorphosed into colourful spots, dots and biomorphic forms which appear to effervesce on the canvas with dynamic force. Glimmering like constellations in the night sky, they are evocative of the vast infinitude of the cosmos.

Diagnosed with an obsessional neurosis, Kusama has famously struggled with hallucinatory visions of infinitely oscillating, kaleidoscopic patterns since her earliest childhood in Japan. These hallucinations have fuelled her unique pictorial idiom throughout her career: “I was always standing at the centre of the obsession,” she recalls, “over the passionate accretion and repetition inside of me"" (Yayoi Kusama cited in: Laura Hoptman, Yayoi Kusama, London 2000, p. 103). Her method of working requires a focus that is at once compulsive and meditative: entirely transfixed, she labours for hours, cathartically translating her inner visions from mind to canvas. The result, as the present work wholly exemplifies, is a transcendent creation that potently shifts from private experience to universal significance. As the artist has proclaimed, “My love for humanity and for the world has always been the driving force and energy behind all that I do” (Yayoi Kusama in conversation with Rosanna Greenstreet, The Guardian, 21 May 2016, online).

Please note that this work is included in the catalogue raisonnne under no. 234 (a. 3187)","Catalogue Note
A rare and pivotal work from Alighiero Boetti's oeuvre, Mimetico from 1968 embodies both the extremes of the Arte Povera movement and the more intimate poetics of Boetti himself. This reworking of an instantly recognisable fabric (the Mimetic Cloth M29, supplied to the Italian army during the Second World War) forces us to re-read the material in a new light, analysing camouflage as a metaphor on various levels. At the same time conceptual and material, this apparently anonymous shred of camouflage fabric becomes a center of reflection on very current issues of the late 1960s: consumerism, workers' strikes and student protests against the Vietnam War.

The decontextualisation of the fabric, decentralised and transformed almost into ready-made decorative wallpaper, increases the sense of estrangement and ambiguity transmitted by the work. The reference to a military-type pattern is not only linked to a reflection on politics and consumerism but is also a nod to the Manifesto of the Arte Povera movement, which was published precisely one year earlier and whose title was ""Arte Povera: Appunti per una guerriglia"" (Arte Povera: notes for a guerrilla war).

In a formal way, Mimetico aims to undermine the very concept of mimesis, which has always been central to art, both from a theoretical and practical point of view: Boetti reproduces a fabric on the finished canvas which is itself an illusionistic take on reality, designed precisely to blend in with nature and disappear into it. An extreme paradox, ironic and profound at the same time, which, in revealing a false reality, manifests the artist's radical approach and the esteem he held for Marcel Duchamp's work.

As explained in the catalogue raisonné of the artist, Boetti linked each work in the little Mimetici serie back to his first use of this fabric, conceived in 1966: as a result, they are dated ""'66"" on the back, while they have been produced two years later, in 1968.

This iconic series, another work from which was exhibited in his first solo exhibition at Galleria Christian Stein in Turin in January 1967, is borne out of the beginnings of Alighiero Boetti's creative research and, in the reworking of various motifs, proves to be the veritable key to reading the artist's subsequent production.

A larger Mimetico is held in the collection of the Stedelijk Museum, while six works dated 1968 from this series, are held in the permanent collection of the MAXXI in Rome.","Provenance

Measuring over two metres tall and nearly three metres wide, the monumental Trinity Bay is a poetic embodiment of Imi Knoebel’s lifelong engagement with colour, seriality and materiality. Composed of aluminium slates of varying thickness fixed onto a panel and creating an interpenetrating display of captivating colour and precise form, the present work encapsulates Knoebel’s five decades of artistic achievements into a series of works that mark the apogee of the artist’s career.

Having studied under Joseph Beuys in the 1960s at the famed Kunstakademie in Dusseldorf, Knoebel drew inspiration from Kazimir Malevich to make black and white canvases on which vertical painted lines divided up the pictorial space. From this time, the artist began working with industrial materials, such as plywood and fibreboard, thereby dematerialising painting and at the same time fulfilling Beuys' ideal of bringing art closer to life. Following the tragic death of his friend and classmate, Blinky Palermo, whom Knoebel viewed as the master of colour, the latter artist unleashed a torrent of tones into his work, transforming his sombre corpus into a sea of colour. In the 1990s, Knoebel adopted aluminium as his preferred material, which he would cut into varied slices, paint in an array of different tonalities and fix onto a large panel. Trinity Bay is thus the culmination of his artistic progression through the decades, bringing together Knoebel’s talent for seriality and ability to use unconventional materials with his newly discovered taste for vivid hues.

Knoebel’s infatuation with seriality and colour is matched by his staunch resistance of art theory. “When I am asked about what I think when I look at a painting,” Knoebel has remarked, “I can only answer that I don’t think at all; I look at it and can only take in the beauty, and I don’t want to see it in relation to anything else. Only what I see, simply because it has its own validity” (Imi Knoebel cited in: Exh. Cat., Wolfsburg, Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, Imi Knoebel: Works 1966-2014, 2014, p. 24). In insisting on seeing painting simply as the physical object in front of him, Knoebel has much in common with his native contemporary Günther Förg, who proposed that abstract art was nothing more than what one saw.

Upon a large backdrop of millennial pink, accents of primary and pastel hues bisect and punctuate, expanding beyond the pictorial field. Riffs of aluminium engulf the picture plane as parallel bars scatter. Joined together to form a makeshift perhaps transitory space, the large panels of aluminium invite the viewer to enter a zone of pure, resonant colour. The result is a phenomenological encounter with the viewer, in which the viewer becomes acutely aware of her own perception in the viewing process. Reflecting on his practice, Imi Knoebel notes that “everything has been done already… Yves Klein has painted his canvas blue, Lucio Fontana has cut slashes into his. What’s left? If you want to do something, to stay alive, you have to think of something at least as radical” (Imi Knoebel cited in: Kate Connolly, ‘Artist Imi Knoebel’, The Guardian, 15 July 2015, online).

In Trinity Bay, Knoebel’s passionate, exacting approach results in a work of both coolness and warmth, suffused with the infinite potential of colour rendered as luminous form. Indeed there is an inherent radicality to Knoebel’s artistic production in his ongoing, elliptical investigation into formalism and the medium of painting itself. It is for this reason, that Knoebel is one of the leading German artists working in the post-war period.","Provenance
